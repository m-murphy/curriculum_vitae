  abstract        = {The discovery of the life-threatening zoonotic infection
                  Plasmodium knowlesi has added to the challenges of prompt and
                  accurate malaria diagnosis and surveillance. In this study
                  from Aceh Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination setting
                  where P. knowlesi endemicity was not previously known, we
                  report the laboratory investigation and difficulties
                  encountered when using molecular detection methods for quality
                  assurance of microscopically identified clinical cases. From
                  2014 to 2015, 20 (49\%) P. falciparum, 16 (39\%) P. vivax, 3
                  (7\%) P. malariae, and 2 (5\%) indeterminate species were
                  identified by microscopy from four sentinel health facilities.
                  At a provincial-level reference laboratory, loop-mediated
                  isothermal amplification ({LAMP}), a field-friendly molecular
                  method, was performed and confirmed Plasmodium in all samples
                  though further species-identification was limited by the
                  unavailability of non-falciparum species-specific testing with
                  the platform used. At a national reference laboratory, several
                  molecular methods including nested {PCR} ({nPCR}) targeting
                  the 18 small sub-unit ({18S}) ribosomal {RNA}, {nPCR}
                  targeting the cytochrome-b (cytb) gene, a P. knowlesi-specific
                  {nPCR}, and finally sequencing, were necessary to ultimately
                  classify the samples as: 19 (46\%) P. knowlesi, 8 (20\%) P.
                  falciparum, 14 (34\%) P. vivax. Microscopy was unable to
                  identify or mis-classified up to 56\% of confirmed cases,
                  including all cases of P. knowlesi. With the {nPCR} methods
                  targeting the four human-only species, P. knowlesi was missed
                  ({18S} {rRNA} method) or showed cross-reactivity for P. vivax
                  (cytb method). To facilitate diagnosis and management of
                  potentially fatal P. knowlesi infection and surveillance for
                  elimination of human-only malaria in Indonesia and other
                  affected settings, new detection methods are needed for
                  testing at the point-of-care and in local reference
                  laboratories.}

                  Plasmodium falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2)
                  and the malaria-conserved antigen lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
                  for P. vivax and other malaria species. The performance of
                  RDTs and their utility is dependent on circulating antigen
                  concentration distributions in infected individuals in a
                  population in which malaria is endemic and on the limit of
                  detection of the RDT for the antigens. A multiplexed
                  immunoassay for the quantification of HRP2, P. vivax LDH, and
                  all-malaria LDH (pan LDH) was developed to accurately measure
                  circulating antigen concentration and antigen distribution in
                  a population with endemic malaria. The assay also measures
                  C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as an indicator of
                  inflammation. Validation was conducted with clinical specimens
                  from 397 asymptomatic donors from Myanmar and Uganda,
                  confirmed by PCR for infection, and from participants in
                  induced blood-stage malaria challenge studies. The assay lower
                  limits of detection for HRP2, pan LDH, P. vivax LDH, and CRP
                  were 0.2 pg/ml, 9.3 pg/ml, 1.5 pg/ml, and 26.6 ng/ml,
                  respectively. At thresholds for HRP2, pan LDH, and P. vivax
                  LDH of 2.3 pg/ml, 47.8 pg/ml, and 75.1 pg/ml, respectively,
                  and a specificity >=98.5\%, the sensitivities for
                  ultrasensitive PCR-confirmed infections were 93.4\%, 84.9\%,
                  and 48.9\%, respectively. Plasmodium LDH (pLDH) concentration,
                  in contrast to that of HRP2, correlated closely with parasite
                  density. CRP levels were moderately higher in P. falciparum
                  infections with confirmed antigenemia versus those in clinical
                  specimens with no antigen. The 4-plex array is a sensitive
                  tool for quantifying diagnostic antigens in malaria infections
                  and supporting the evaluation of new ultrasensitive RDTs.},

                  decline in Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in the
                  past decade and is targeted for elimination. Zambia‚Äôs National
                  Malaria Elimination Program recommends reactive case detection
                  (RCD) within 140 m of index households to enhance surveillance
                  and eliminate remaining transmission foci.To evaluate whether
                  RCD captures local transmission, we genotyped 26
                  microsatellites from 106 samples collected from index (n = 27)
                  and secondary (n = 79) cases detected through RCD in the Macha
                  Hospital catchment area between January 2015 and April
                  2016.Participants from the same RCD event harbored more
                  genetically related parasites than those from different RCD
                  events, suggesting that RCD captures, at least in part,
                  infections related through local transmission. Related
                  parasites clustered in space and time, up to at least 250 m
                  from index households. Spatial analysis identified a putative
                  focal transmission hotspot.The current RCD strategy detects
                  focal transmission events, although programmatic guidelines to
                  screen within 140 m of index households may fail to capture
                  all secondary cases. This study highlights the utility of
                  parasite genetic data in assessing programmatic interventions,
                  and similar approaches may be useful to malaria elimination
                  programs seeking to tailor intervention strategies to the
                  underlying transmission epidemiology.}",

  abstract        = {{BACKGROUND}: To better understand transmission dynamics,
                  we characterized Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity in
                  Eswatini, where transmission is low and sustained by
                  importation. {METHODS}: Twenty-six P. falciparum
                  microsatellites were genotyped in 66\% of confirmed cases
                  (2014-2016; N = 582). Population and within-host diversity
                  were used to characterize differences between imported and
                  locally acquired infections. Logistic regression was used to
                  assess the added value of diversity metrics to classify
                  imported and local infections beyond epidemiology data alone.
                  {RESULTS}: Parasite population in Eswatini was highly diverse
                  (expected heterozygosity [{HE}] = 0.75) and complex: 67\%
                  polyclonal infections, mean multiplicity of infection ({MOI})
                  2.2, and mean within-host infection fixation index ({FWS})
                  0.84. Imported cases had comparable diversity to local cases
                  but exhibited higher {MOI} (2.4 vs 2.0; P = .004) and lower
                  mean {FWS} (0.82 vs 0.85; P = .03). Addition of {MOI} and
                  {FWS} to multivariate analyses did not increase discrimination
                  between imported and local infections. {CONCLUSIONS}: In
                  contrast to the common perception that P. falciparum diversity
                  declines with decreasing transmission intensity, Eswatini
                  isolates exhibited high parasite diversity consistent with
                  high rates of malaria importation and limited local
                  transmission. Estimates of malaria transmission intensity from
                  genetic data need to consider the effect of importation,
                  especially as countries near elimination. \copyright The

  abstract        = {Abstract The development of vaccines against malaria and
                  serodiagnostic tests for detecting recent exposure requires
                  tools for antigen discovery and suitable animal models. The
                  protein microarray is a high-throughput, sample sparing
                  technique, with applications in infectious disease research,
                  clinical diagnostics, epidemiology, and vaccine development.
                  We recently demonstrated Qdot-based indirect
                  immunofluorescence together with portable optical imager
                  ArrayCAM using single isotype detection could replicate data
                  using the conventional laser confocal scanner system. We
                  developed a multiplexing protocol for simultaneous detection
                  of IgG, IgA, and IgM and compared samples from a controlled
                  human malaria infection model with those from controlled
                  malaria infections of Aotus nancymaae, a widely used non-human
                  primate model of human malaria. IgG profiles showed the
                  highest concordance in number of reactive antigens; thus, of
                  the 139 antigens recognized by human IgG antibody, 111 were
                  also recognized by Aotus monkeys. Interestingly, IgA profiles
                  were largely non-overlapping. Finally, on the path toward
                  wider deployment of the portable platform, we show excellent
                  correlations between array data obtained in five independent
                  laboratories around the United States using the multiplexing
                  protocol (R2: 0.60‚Äì0.92). This study supports the use of this
                  platform for wider deployment, particularly in endemic areas
                  where such a tool will have the greatest impact on global
                  human health.},

  abstract        = {Local and cross-border importation remain major challenges
                  to malaria elimination and are difficult to measure using
                  traditional surveillance data. To address this challenge, we
                  systematically collected parasite genetic data and travel
                  history from thousands of malaria cases across northeastern
                  Namibia and estimated human mobility from mobile phone data.
                  We observed strong fine-scale spatial structure in local
                  parasite populations, providing positive evidence that the
                  majority of cases were due to local transmission. This result
                  was largely consistent with estimates from mobile phone and
                  travel history data. However, genetic data identified more
                  detailed and extensive evidence of parasite connectivity over
                  hundreds of kilometers than the other data, within Namibia and
                  across the Angolan and Zambian borders. Our results provide a
                  framework for incorporating genetic data into malaria
                  surveillance and provide evidence that both strengthening of
                  local interventions and regional coordination are likely
                  necessary to eliminate malaria in this region of Southern
                  Africa. \copyright 2019, Tessema et al.}
