abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Subpatent malaria infections, or low-density infections below the detection threshold of microscopy or standard rapid diagnostic testing ({RDT}), can perpetuate persistent transmission and, therefore, may be a barrier for countries like Namibia that are pursuing malaria elimination. This potential burden in Namibia has not been well characterized. {METHODS}: Using a two-stage cluster sampling, cross-sectional design, subjects of all age were enrolled during the end of the 2015 malaria transmission season in Zambezi region, located in northeast Namibia. Malaria {RDTs} were performed with subsequent gold standard testing by loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP}) using dried blood spots. Infection prevalence was measured and the diagnostic accuracy of {RDT} calculated. Relationships between recent fever, demographics, epidemiological factors, and infection were assessed. {RESULTS}: Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection was low: 0.8\% (16/1919) by {RDT} and 2.2\% (43/1919) by {LAMP}. All but one {LAMP}-positive infection was {RDT}-negative. Using {LAMP} as gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of {RDT} were 2.3\% and 99.2\%, respectively. Compared to {LAMP}-negative infections, a higher portion {LAMP}-positive infections were associated with fever (45.2\% vs. 30.4\%, p = 0.04), though 55\% of infections were not associated with fever. Agricultural occupations and cattle herding were significantly associated with {LAMP}-detectable infection (Adjusted {ORs} 5.02, 95\% {CI} 1.77-14.23, and 11.82, 95\% {CI} 1.06-131.81, respectively), while gender, travel, bed net use, and indoor residual spray coverage were not. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study presents results from the first large-scale malaria cross-sectional survey from Namibia using molecular testing to characterize subpatent infections. Findings suggest that fever history and standard {RDTs} are not useful to address this burden. Achievement of malaria elimination may require active case detection using more sensitive point-of-care diagnostics or presumptive treatment and targeted to high-risk groups.}

abstract = {The discovery of the life-threatening zoonotic infection Plasmodium knowlesi has added to the challenges of prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis and surveillance. In this study from Aceh Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination setting where P. knowlesi endemicity was not previously known, we report the laboratory investigation and difficulties encountered when using molecular detection methods for quality assurance of microscopically identified clinical cases. From 2014 to 2015, 20 (49\%) P. falciparum, 16 (39\%) P. vivax, 3 (7\%) P. malariae, and 2 (5\%) indeterminate species were identified by microscopy from four sentinel health facilities. At a provincial-level reference laboratory, loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP}), a field-friendly molecular method, was performed and confirmed Plasmodium in all samples though further species-identification was limited by the unavailability of non-falciparum species-specific testing with the platform used. At a national reference laboratory, several molecular methods including nested {PCR} ({nPCR}) targeting the 18 small sub-unit ({18S}) ribosomal {RNA}, {nPCR} targeting the cytochrome-b (cytb) gene, a P. knowlesi-specific {nPCR}, and finally sequencing, were necessary to ultimately classify the samples as: 19 (46\%) P. knowlesi, 8 (20\%) P. falciparum, 14 (34\%) P. vivax. Microscopy was unable to identify or mis-classified up to 56\% of confirmed cases, including all cases of P. knowlesi. With the {nPCR} methods targeting the four human-only species, P. knowlesi was missed ({18S} {rRNA} method) or showed cross-reactivity for P. vivax (cytb method). To facilitate diagnosis and management of potentially fatal P. knowlesi infection and surveillance for elimination of human-only malaria in Indonesia and other affected settings, new detection methods are needed for testing at the point-of-care and in local reference laboratories.}

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The detection of submicroscopic infections in low prevalence settings has become an increasingly important challenge for malaria elimination strategies. The current field rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) for Plasmodium falciparum malaria are inadequate to detect low-density infections. Therefore, there is a need to develop more sensitive field diagnostic tools. In parallel, a highly sensitive laboratory reference assay will be essential to evaluate new diagnostic tools. Recently, the highly sensitive Alere\texttrademark Malaria Ag P.f {ELISA} ({HS} {ELISA}) was developed to detect P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 ({HRP2}) in clinical whole blood specimens. In this study, the analytical and clinical performance of the {HS} {ELISA} was determined using recombinant P. falciparum {HRP2}, P. falciparum native culture parasites, and archived highly pedigreed clinical whole blood specimens from Karen village, Myanmar and Nagongera, Uganda. {RESULTS}: The {HS} {ELISA} has an analytical sensitivity of less than 25 pg/{mL} and shows strong specificity for P. falciparum {HRP2} when tested against P. falciparum native culture strains with pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions. Additionally, the Z'-factor statistic of 0.862 indicates the {HS} {ELISA} as an excellent, reproducible assay, and the coefficients of variation for inter- and intra-plate testing, 11.76\% and 2.51\%, were acceptable. Against clinical whole blood specimens with concordant microscopic and {PCR} results, the {HS} {ELISA} showed 100\% (95\% {CI} 96.4-100) diagnostic sensitivity and 97.9\% (95\% {CI} 94.8-99.4) diagnostic specificity. For P. falciparum positive specimens with {HRP2} concentrations below 400 pg/{mL}, the sensitivity and specificity were 100\% (95\% {CI} 88.4-100) and 88.9\% (95\% {CI} 70.8-97.6), respectively. The overall sensitivity and specificity for all 352 samples were 100\% ({CI} 95\% 96-100\%) and 97.3\% ({CI} 95\% 94-99\%). {CONCLUSIONS}: The {HS} {ELISA} is a robust and reproducible assay. The findings suggest that the {HS} {ELISA} may be a useful tool as an affordable reference assay for new ultra-sensitive {HRP2}-based {RDTs}.}

abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) detect primarily Plasmodium (P.) falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein 2 ({HRP2}) and the malaria-conserved antigen lactate dehydrogenase ({LDH}) for P. vivax and other malaria species. The performance of {RDTs} and their utility is dependent on circulating antigen concentration distributions in infected individuals in a malaria endemic population and the limit-of-detection of the {RDT} for the antigens. A multiplexed immunoassay for the quantification of {HRP2}, P. vivax {LDH} and all malaria {LDH} (Pan {LDH}) was developed to measure accurately circulating antigen concentration and their distribution in an endemic population. The assay also measures C -reactive protein ({CRP}) as an indicator of inflammation. {METHODS}: Validation was conducted with clinical specimens from 397 asymptomatic donors from Myanmar and Uganda confirmed by {PCR} for infection and from participants in induced blood-stage malaria challenge studies. {RESULTS}: The assay has lower limit-of-detection for {HRP2}, Pan {LDH}, P. vivax {LDH} and {CRP} were 0.2 pg/{mL}, 9.3 pg/{mL}, 1.5 pg/{mL} and 26.6 ng/{mL}, respectively. At thresholds for {HRP2}, Pan {LDH}, and P. vivax {LDH} of 2.3 pg/{mL}, 47.8 pg/{mL}, and 75.1 pg/{mL}, respectively, and specificity ≥ 98.5\%, sensitivities for ultrasensitive {PCR} confirmed infections were 93.4, 84.9 and 48.9\% respectively. Plasmodium {LDH} ({pLDH}) concentration correlated closely with parasite density, in contrast to {HRP2}. {CRP} levels were moderately higher in P. falciparum infections with confirmed antigenemia versus clinical specimens with no antigen. {CONCLUSIONS}: The 4-plex array is a sensitive tool for quantifying diagnostic antigens in malaria infections and supporting the evaluation of new ultrasensitive {RDTs}.

abstract = {Background: Southern Province, Zambia, has experienced a dramatic decline in Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in the past decade and is targeted for elimination. Zambia's National Malaria Elimination Program recommends reactive case detection ({RCD}) within 140m of index households to enhance surveillance and eliminate remaining transmission foci. Methods: To evaluate whether {RCD} captures local transmission, we genotyped 26 microsatellites from 106 samples collected from index (n=27) and secondary (n=79) cases detected through {RCD} in the Macha Hospital catchment area between January 2015 and April 2016. Results: Participants from the same {RCD} event harbored more genetically related parasites than those from different {RCD} events, suggesting that {RCD} captures, at least in part, infections related through local transmission. Related parasites clustered in space and time, up to at least 250m from index households. Spatial analysis identified a putative focal transmission hotspot. Conclusions: The current {RCD} strategy detects focal transmission events, although programmatic guidelines to screen within 140m of index households may fail to capture all secondary cases. This study highlights the utility of parasite genetic data in assessing programmatic interventions, and similar approaches may be useful to malaria elimination programs seeking to tailor intervention strategies to the underlying transmission epidemiology.}

We recently demonstrated Qdot-based indirect immunofluorescence together with portable optical imager {ArrayCAM} using single isotype detection could replicate data using the conventional laser confocal scanner system. We developed a multiplexing protocol for simultaneous detection of {IgG}, {IgA}, and {IgM} and compared samples from a controlled human malaria infection model with those from controlled malaria infections of Aotus nancymaae, a widely used non-human primate model of human malaria. {IgG} profiles showed the highest concordance in number of reactive antigens; thus, of the 139 antigens recognized by human {IgG} antibody, 111 were also recognized by Aotus monkeys. Interestingly, {IgA} profiles were largely non-overlapping. Finally, on the path toward wider deployment of the portable platform, we show excellent correlations between array data obtained in five independent laboratories around the United States using the multiplexing protocol (R2 : 0.60-0.92). This study supports the use of this platform for wider deployment, particularly in endemic areas where such a tool will have the greatest impact on global human health. \copyright 2017 {WILEY}-{VCH} Verlag {GmbH} \& Co. {KGaA}, Weinheim.}

abstract = {Accurately identifying and targeting the human reservoir of malaria parasitemia is critical for malaria control, and requires a reliable and sensitive diagnostic method. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification ({LAMP}) is increasingly used to diagnose submicroscopic parasitemia. Although most published studies report the sensitivity of {LAMP} compared with nested polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) as ≥ 80\%, they have failed to use a consistent, sensitive diagnostic as a comparator. We used cross-sectional samples from children and adults in Tororo, Uganda, a region with high but declining transmission due to indoor residual spraying, to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of pan-Plasmodium {LAMP} for detecting submicroscopic infections. We compared {LAMP} results targeting a mitochondrial {DNA} sequence conserved in all Plasmodium species, performed on {DNA} extracted from dried blood spots, to those of a gold standard quantitative {PCR} assay targeting the var gene acidic terminal sequence of Plasmodium falciparum ({varATS} {qPCR}), performed on {DNA} extracted from 200 {\muL} of whole blood. Using {LAMP} and {varATS} {qPCR} increased the detection of parasitemia 2- to 5-fold, compared with microscopy. Among microscopy-negative samples, the sensitivity of {LAMP} was 81.5\% for detecting infection ≥ 1 parasites/{\muL}. However, low density infections were common, and {LAMP} failed to identify more than half of all infections diagnosed by {varATS} {qPCR}, performing with an overall sensitivity of 44.7\% for detecting submicroscopic infections ≥ 0.01 parasites/{\muL}. Thus, although the {LAMP} assay is more sensitive than microscopy, it missed a significant portion of the submicroscopic reservoir. These findings have important implications for malaria control, particularly in settings where low-density infections predominate.}

abstract = {Background: The performance of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests ({RDTs}) to evaluate suspected malaria in low-endemicity settings has not been well characterized. Methods: Using dried blood spot samples from patients with suspected malaria at 37 health facilities from 2012 to 2014 in the low-endemicity country of Swaziland, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of histidine-rich protein 2-based {RDTs} using qualitative polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) (nested {PCR} targeting the cytochrome b gene) and quantitative {PCR} as reference standards. To explore reasons for false-negative and/or false-positive results, we used pfhrp2/3-specific {PCR} and logistic regression analyses of potentially associated epidemiological factors. Results: From 1353 patients, 93.0\% of {RDT}-positive (n = 185) and 31.2\% of {RDT}-negative samples (n = 340) were available and selected for testing. Compared with nested {PCR}, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV}), and negative predictive value ({NPV}) of {RDTs} were 51.7\%, 94.1\%, 67.3\%, and 89.1\%, respectively. After exclusion of samples with parasite densities \textless 100/μL, which accounted for 75.7\% of false-negative results and 33.3\% of {PCR}-detectable infections, the sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, and {NPV} were 78.8\%, 93.7\%, 62.3\%, and 97.1\%. Deletions of pfhrp2 were not detected. False-positivity was more likely during the second year and was not associated with demographics, recent malaria, health facility testing characteristics, or potential {DNA} degradation. Conclusions: In the low-transmission setting of Swaziland, we demonstrated low sensitivity of {RDT} for malaria diagnosis, owing to an unexpectedly high proportion of low-density infection among symptomatic subjects. The {PPV} was also low, requiring further investigation. A more accurate point-of-care diagnostic may be needed to support malaria elimination efforts. \copyright The Author 2017.

abstract = {As many malaria-endemic countries move towards elimination of Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria parasite, effective tools for monitoring malaria epidemiology are urgent priorities. P. falciparum population genetic approaches offer promising tools for understanding transmission and spread of the disease, but a high prevalence of multi-clone or polygenomic infections can render estimation of even the most basic parameters, such as allele frequencies, challenging. A previous method, {COIL}, was developed to estimate complexity of infection ({COI}) from single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) data, but relies on monogenomic infections to estimate allele frequencies or requires external allele frequency data which may not available. Estimates limited to monogenomic infections may not be representative, however, and when the average {COI} is high, they can be difficult or impossible to obtain. Therefore, we developed {THE} {REAL} {McCOIL}, Turning {HEterozygous} {SNP} data into Robust Estimates of {ALelle} frequency, via Markov chain Monte Carlo, and Complexity Of Infection using Likelihood, to incorporate polygenomic samples and simultaneously estimate allele frequency and {COI}. This approach was tested via simulations then applied to {SNP} data from cross-sectional surveys performed in three Ugandan sites with varying malaria transmission. We show that {THE} {REAL} {McCOIL} consistently outperforms {COIL} on simulated data, particularly when most infections are polygenomic. Using field data we show that, unlike with {COIL}, we can distinguish epidemiologically relevant differences in {COI} between and within these sites. Surprisingly, for example, we estimated high average {COI} in a peri-urban subregion with lower transmission intensity, suggesting that many of these cases were imported from surrounding regions with higher transmission intensity. {THE} {REAL} {McCOIL} therefore provides a robust tool for understanding the molecular epidemiology of malaria across transmission settings.}
