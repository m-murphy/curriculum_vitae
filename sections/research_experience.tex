            \small Conducted large scale multiplex and nested PCR experiments to generate genetic data for malaria transmission mapping.  Developed data analysis pipeline and graphical user interface for high-throughput analysis of genetic data from malaria causing parasites. Developed applications for tracking clinical samples used in lab, and data visualization tools for analyzing transmission network based data. Carried out administrative duties of lab, managed other members of the lab, conducted PCR experiments on clinical samples, liaised with foreign clinical labs and provided technical support for protocols.
